There must be an "on" button
somewhere.

00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,043
Did you press the apple thing ?

[ yelling ]
wait !  Hansel !

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,912
Let's not lose our cool.
Then we're no better
than the machine.

8
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:03,366
It's almost 7:00.
I gotta go.

9
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,086
No !  Derek.  Der, wait.

10
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:08,721
If you go, they'll make you
kill that eurasian dude.

11
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:12,275
I don't care, hansel.
I've never been late for a show
in my life.

12
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:16,162
And I don't plan
on starting now.
Damn it, you're right.

13
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:20,727
Do me a favor.  If anything
happens to me, I want you
to give this to matilda.

14
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,354
- Oh, no.
- Please, hansel.
Take it.  Please.

15
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,206
- Ah, man.
- Take it.

16
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:33,763
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.

17
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:36,432
Go !  Go !
