16
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:13,009
We clawed, we chained,
our hearts in vain

17
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,999
We jumped
never asking why

18
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,869
We kissed,
I fell under your spell

19
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,679
A love no one could deny

20
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,419
Don’t you ever say I just walked away

21
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,539
I will always want you

22
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,469
I can’t live a lie
running for my life

23
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,709
I will always want you

24
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,079
I came in like a wrecking ball

25
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,139
I never hit so hard in love

26
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,999
All I wanted was to break your walls

27
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:58,929
All you ever did was break me

28
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,549
Yeah you
you wreck me

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,979
I put you high up in the sky

30
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,080
And now
you’re not coming down

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,870
It slowly turned,
you let me burn

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,490
And now
we’re ashes on the ground

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,290
Don’t you ever say
I just walked away

34
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,350
I will always want you

I never hit so hard in love

39

I came in like a wrecking ball

42
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,141
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung

43
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,891
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall

44
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:06,881
All you ever did was break me

45
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:10,681
Yeah you
you wreck me

46
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:17,111
I never meant to start a war

47
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:20,861
I just wanted you to let me in

48
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:25,291
And instead of using force

49
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:29,221
I guess I should’ve let you in

50
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:33,211
I never meant to start a war

51
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,831
I just wanted you to let me in

00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:40,641
